This folder includes relevant codes to test 1-day, 1-scene neural network retrieval over China in Li et al., JRS, 2021.

1) The main scripts include:

1. TROPOMI.py: I/O interfaces of various satellite and complementary input data for
the retrieval.

2. MLPros.py: Various modules for AI processing and implementation used in
ANNNO2.py

3. ANNNO2.py: Main program to do the retrieval for a single day and specified
region

Main inputs:
DataDir: folder of all necessary inputs (downloadable for September 2, 2019
over China at Mega Drive: )

parser params:
--year --month --day: YYYYMMDD to identifile files to accumulate
--Region: string identifier to locate min/max latitudes and longitudes of the
retrieval. For the example inputs, a Region name of "CN" is pre-defined. See and modify example Lines 40-70 in the code to define your own
region

The output files of NN retrievals are at $DataDir/ANNs/$Region.

4. InterpNO2.py: Interpolate the retrievals from separate NN models trained
using SRFs of TROPOMI's 0th, 50th, 100th, .... 400th,
and 449th detection rows to the rows not covered.

The output files of NN retrievals are at $DataDir/ANNs/$Region/Interp.

parser params:
--Region: same meaning as in ANNNO2.py
--buffer: the buffer range (in DU) for merging retrievals from high- and
low-NO2 NN models. See Equation 4 in Li et al., JRS, 2021.

2) How to run the program:

1. Install all required packaged in requirements.txt (Note: you need to
install hdf4 libraries first before pyhdf could be installed)

2. Change the directory location of "DataDir" in bash script RunANN.sh
(locations all the inputs are downloaded to).

3. Run the bash script. The retrievals and row-interpolation will be
processed, provided that all the input data are available.

3) Output file

NetCDF files in the $DataDir/ANNs/$Region/Interp/ folder. Most of the variable
names are self-explainary. Important variables are listed below:

Cloud_Fraction_Geo: geometric cloud fraction
Cloud_Fraction_Rad: cloud radiance fraction, only used to merge cloudy and
non-cloudy NO2 columns (Equation 5)

NO2_std_TOTCol: total NO2 column from level2 TROPOMI
NO2_std_TROPCol: tropospheric NO2 column from level2 TROPOMI

NO2_TOTCol: merged total NO2 column from NN

NO2_TOTCol_clear: merged total NO2 column from NN under clear assumptions
NO2_TOTCol_clear_High: total NO2 column from the high-NO2 (>0.4 DU) NN model under clear assuptions
NO2_TOTCol_clear_Low: total NO2 column from the low-NO2 (<0.4 DU) NN model under clear assuptions

NO2_TOTCol_cloudy: merged total NO2 column from NN under fully cloudy assumptions
NO2_TOTCol_cloudy_High: total NO2 column from the high-NO2 (>0.4 DU) NN model under fully cloudy assuptions
NO2_TOTCol_clouy_Low: total NO2 column from the low-NO2 (<0.4 DU) NN model under fully cloudy assuptions
